Columns
========
dont use col-md-*
use col-lg-* for regular column

Break Points
===========
Main break point is 991px - at 991px everything collapses
but
Mobile breakpoint is 1024px or iOS devices - not compromisable (header links requirement)
Mobile devices dont have hover so because of click requirement for the devices,
header menu will collapse at 1024px or if it observes any device
ipad has 1024px screen if rotated

Dependencies
============
Its bootstrap 4 in here in system
and jQuery 3
So plz do not use bootstrap 3 - consult bootstrap 4 docs
